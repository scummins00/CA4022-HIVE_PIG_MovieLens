# CA4022-HIVE_PIG_MovieLens
This repository is to hold the scripts and accompanying files used to clean and analyse the MovieLens dataset. Cleaning and analysis was performed using Hadoop's PIG and Hive.

##Local Mode vs MapReduce Mode
PIG can be used in both *local mode*, and *MapReduce mode*. Using PIG in local mode is considered better for debugging.
To allow for a better workflow, I have kept a copy of the data and outputs in my repository. There is also a copy of
the data on the **Hadoop Distributed File System** (HDFS).
