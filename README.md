# CA4022-HIVE_PIG_MovieLens
This repository is to hold the scripts and accompanying files used to clean and analyse the MovieLens dataset. Cleaning and analysis was performed using Hadoop's PIG and Hive. This repository is available online [here](https://github.com/scummins00/CA4022-HIVE_PIG_MovieLens).

Please find **all cleaning and analysis scripts** available in the main folder of this repository.

Please find **The Final PDF** also available in the main branch of this repository.

## Local Mode vs MapReduce Mode
PIG can be used in both *local mode*, and *MapReduce mode*. Using PIG in local mode is considered better for debugging.
To allow for a better workflow, I have kept a copy of the data and outputs in my repository. There is also a copy of
the data on the **Hadoop Distributed File System** (HDFS).
